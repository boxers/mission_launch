			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">The presentation was today. 30 minutes into the class, I was a bit worried that Durell might not show up.
				But he showed up, and I felt that the presentation went pretty well. We didn't have much time to present though. Due to some technical
				difficulties, we lost about 20 minutes of class time. But Durell and I aren't good at communicating anyways, or rather, we usually
				like to get straight to the point. So the less time to present, the better.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Overall, I felt that this was a really good experience. It was a bit miserable, due to other demanding classes,
					but overall, it was good. If my other classes weren't so hectic, I'm sure I would have enjoyed this project more. 
					Also, Durell is a very smart guy and I'm glad that I got the chance to work with him. I was able to learn a lot from him.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 30, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Met up with Durell today to discuss tomorrow's presentation. We'll be skipping out on using
				power point slides, since our program provides the visuals for all of the things we'll be talking about. We'll just 
				mainly present using the program and website as visual aids. There are a lot of things about the program itself that
				we can talk about, and it demonstrates pretty much all of the concepts considered when we were progressing
				with the project.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Today, I did some fine tuning on the flight path, to make it a bit "smarter". The flight path algorithm still
				needs a lot of fine tuning.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Some of the adjustments that I made on the flight path algorithm and calculation of gravity didn't
				work out so well, and had to be thrown out. They either didn't work, or they were just too computationally intensive.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 26, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I'm running on fumes at this point. I implemented fuel usage, collision detection, and shuttle
				acceleration. The shuttle's acceleration and fuel usage were implemented using the shuttle specs provided in Durell's
				notes. After implementing them, I conducted some extensive testing.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Due to the exaggeration of planet sizes and whatnot, an occurrence of a collision may be a bit
				confusing, as you might see a shuttle flying through a planetary body. But if they really do collide, the flight will stop, and
				a "Mission failure" message will display in the result box along with the culprit behind the collision.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 23, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Met up with Durell today to discuss wrapping up the project. We're just gonna finish up fixing the issues
				with gravity and then implement the shuttle's acceleration, fuel usage, and collision detection. I'll do that whenever I find
				time to do it.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 21, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I spent lots of time today doing research on gravity and finding equations. I couldn't put much
				of Durell's notes on gravity into use.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">While implementing gravity, I found that my calculus textbook doesn't really show how to get force vectors
				to work with velocity vectors. I learned that force, velocity, and acceleration are three different things. For someone
				who has never taken physics, this wasn't very intuitive for me. Unfortunately the shuttle was implemented to move using
				velocity vectors. So now, the current problems we're facing is finding a way to use force vectors with velocity vectors,
				and debugging the effects of gravity on the space shuttle.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">For today, I've got some semi-working gravitational forces and a visual for the space shuttle implemented.
				At this point, I'm starting to feel really frustrated. I have to code, maintain the website, repository, and the journals, do
				research on Physics and Astronomy, find patterns and brainstorm solutions to make things work,
				and fish out equations needed from my old math textbooks. All of this stuff is starting to really affect my performance in my
				other classes.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">We still have collision detection as well as the shuttle's acceleration and fuel usage to implement. The only thing keeping me
				motivated with this project is that I enjoy solving problems, but at this point, I'm just burned out. I blame myself on planning
				things out poorly, having poor communication skills, and asking the wrong questions, because I know Durell is a smart guy and that he's trying hard. So
				I'm not blaming any of this on Durell. This is just too much work for two people who don't have much knowledge on the domain
				of this problem.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 17, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Durell finally emailed me the stuff on gravity. I can't really use it though. The equation isn't accurate and
				the notes do not include what types of units the variables are supposed to be in (for example, km or m, kg or g, seconds or hours, etc).
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 11, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I finally figured this vector stuff out and switched from triangulating the shuttle's position to actually
				moving it using vectors. At least the triangulation wasn't a total waste of time. It helped me in debugging the implementation
				of vectors. So some good actually came out of that.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I also found the formulas for converting polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates. They were
				such simple formulas too. Now that was a complete waste of time. The internet is so full of useless answers. This is why I usually don't resort to using Google for finding
				answers.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">The program is now ready for gravity to be implemented. I just need Durell to figure out this gravity stuff,
				since he's taken Physics and has seen this stuff before.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 8, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Today, I reviewed my calculus textbooks. This vector stuff is confusing. I don't remember any of it.
				So instead, I resorted to triangulating the shuttle's coordinates and where it's supposed to be, given a fixed velocity using
				lots of trig functions (Edit: Another huge waste of time and effort. I'll get back to this later on). For right now, I'll be avoiding gravitational
				forces until I can figure this vector stuff out.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I was able to finish implementing Durell's algorithm tonight and found something peculiar about it.
				The success of the flight is highly dependent on the speed of the shuttle. Also, the faster the shuttle, the straighter its
				flightpath will be. The speed of the shuttle needed to be around the same speed as the destination planet's orbital velocity. Maybe once
				gravity has been implemented, then we could do something about this.
			</p>

		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 7, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Durell presented the pathfinding algorithm to be used today, but absolutely no
				real equations for calculating it. Neither of us has a clue on implementing the vectors needed to move
				the space shuttle in our program. Due to a group project that's due tomorrow, I most likely won't have time
				to implement it until April 9, since I have to break out and review my old calculus textbook.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">April 5, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Worked on a few solutions to the problems we encountered yesterday, while brainstorming ways on
				how to handle path finding for the shuttle's flightpath. Mainly the problems with:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The initial starting point and launch angle.</li>
				<li>Keeping track of the shuttle's location at all times.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I drew out the problem and found various patterns. I found that we could triangulate the shuttle's
				location at all times by storing and using the heliocentric coordinates of the shuttle, and the destination planet.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 31, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">We met up today and reviewed what has been completed so far and what needs to be done next.
				At this point, I'm just waiting on Durell to come up with an algorithm for the flightpath.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 29, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Today I finished implementing the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune into the program. We'll
				be excluding Pluto, since it's not technically a planet. I'm still deciding whether to use actual images for the planets or to
				just color code them.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I also finished implementing auto-zooming in and out depending on what planets are involved in the
				calculations.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 28, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Today I did some more work on the UI for the program and wrote instructions for compiling the program.
				I updated the website with the new schedule as well as the instructions for compiling and running the program.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 27, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Had a meeting with Durell today. We discussed and created a new schedule for the project. We
				also discussed changes on simplifying our program. The initial plans were just too ambitious for two people to
				handle in one semester, or rather half a semester. Due to other projects and a hectic schedule, I couldn't really start
				on this project until after midterms. Also, we discussed how to handle the scaling of the planets. We decided to exaggerate
				the sizes of the planets and zoom out and in depending on what planets are involved in our calculations. Because fitting all
				of the planets of the solar system onto a 1280X1024 drawing panel is not an easy task.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I reviewed the calculations of the program and rechecked the math. I fixed a few errors in calculating
				the planets' positions. I didn't realize that months started with a zero in Java. After fixing this, the planets are now
				orbiting smoothly.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">After debugging the program, I cleaned up and modularized lots of the code. This should make it easy
				for Durell to read and modify the code.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I updated the user interface of the program with things that we're currently concerned with for the project.
				Added some more functionality to the program, so that it'll update the planets positions based on a given date. I then compared
				it with other online applications that do the same. I found that Earth's position was off. I compared the calculations with actual
				planetary position data from the almanac. I did not know that these things were recorded... For some reason the calculations for
				Earth's heliocentric longitude was off.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I investigated the AstroLib library, looked through the source code, and found the cause for this. It
				was adding an extra unit of Pi to Earth's heliocentric longitude to carry out its own calculations. Subtracting that unit
				of Pi on my end fixed everything. All of the planets' positions are aligned with other online applications now.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 26, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Today I created a program to visualize and simulate the orbits of planets. I started
				off with just the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. I plotted out and drew their orbits and compared it
				with other orbit simulators found online. The orbit patterns were the same! Since we're dealing with a 2D plane
				for this project, we'll just be concerned with the heliocentric distance and longitude of planets for mapping
				them out.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I had trouble mapping the planets since I was dealing with polar coordinates. I had no
				idea how to convert them to rectangular coordinates. So I used an arc to map out the planets using the end
				points of the arc. (Edit: Stupid and inefficient, I know. We'll return to this later on when I realized my mistake.
				So many hours wasted on this because I completely forgot all the pre-calc stuff that I learned. It's been
				three year since I've seen any trigonometry or calculus.)
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">After deciding on the resolution for the drawing space, I faced another dilemma. How to handle the
				scaling of the planets. Using a 1280X1024, I found that if we were to include the orbits of the further planets, such as
				Uranus and Neptune, then the Sun would not even take up one whole pixel on the drawing panel. I'll discuss this with
				Durell tomorrow. For now, I'm content with just simulating the planet's orbits, plus it's getting late. 
				This project is starting to become pretty fun.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I updated the website and the repository with the source code for the prototype.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Development of the prototype was fast, since I do lots of coding as a hobby and 
				because I have a huge library of my own personal projects. Hence, lots of reusable code and experience.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 25, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I had a lot of doubts about whether or not we could succeed with this project. I talked with
				Frank today, and he really helped to simplify our tasks and helped give me a better understanding of what needs to be
				done to get this project started. This project really seems doable now.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">We were originally going to follow a development style similar to what I've done in CSC3380 and CSC4330,
				but it's not working out. We're getting nowhere with it. I'm gonna create a quick prototype of the program and start off
				by simulating planetary positioning and planetary orbits. Just to get some visuals going and help get an understanding of
				what we're dealing with. Things are so much easier to understand when you can see them in action.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I went over Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion. Found various sources about calculating planetary positions.
				I learned a lot of new things about calculating a planet's position based on a given date, which
				must converted to Julian Dates, and also about astronomical units. I learned about coordinate systems for actually mapping a planet's position. I'll be using
				a heliocentric polar coordinate system which is a sun-centered polar coordinate system, since seeing things revolving around
				the sun is what we're most familiar with.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">A lot of the calculations involved for calculating a planet's position is really tedious. Since
				there are libraries out there that already do these calculations, I went and found one that would provide all the calculations
				that I would need to map a planet's position and to simulate their orbits. I found a Java library called AstroLib, which provides
				me with everything I need. Things such as: Julian date conversions, heliocentric longitude, latitude, and distance. It automatically
				does all the tedious stuff involving orbital elements of a planet, so I don't have to worry about those, which is great!
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">After I got home, I downloaded AstroLib and created a test program to see how accurate the calculations were.
				I tested the calculations using the examples on the sites that I found for calculating a planet's position. I found the calculations
				to be accurate to within at least three decimal places. This should be good enough for the project. I'll create the prototype program
				after class tomorrow.
			</p>
	    </div>
        <div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 23, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Googled and gathered information that might be useful for the project. Things
				such as planetary facts, gravity, planetary orbits, Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, etc.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Updated the website with all the resources that Durell and I have gathered. I'll
				read over them later.
			</p>
	    </div>
		<div class="block_item">
			<h2 style="line-height: 1em">March 16, 2014</h2>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I got the website up and running today. Since Durell has never done anything involving
				html before, it looks like I'll be in charge of updating and maintaining the web page. It's a good thing that
				I'm teaching myself web stuff this semester.
			</p>
			<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Also, since Durell hasn't taken CSC3380 yet and because I have more experience with coding,
				I guess I'll be the main coder for this project. Most of the complicated stuff will be the actual algorithms, calculations,
				and equations themselves anyways. Since Durell is the only one who has taken Physics in this group, I'll leave that to him and I'll
				handle all of the coding and web stuff, and keeping the repository up-to-date.
