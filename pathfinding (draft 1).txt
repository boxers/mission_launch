i - time interval
-t - length of interval
a - engine acceleration

t[i] - time to reach the target at its position at time interval i

Ve[i] - shuttle velocity at time interval i
-Ve[i+1] - shuttle velocity at the next interval

V[h] - heading vector
-A[h] - angle of V[h]

V[tc] - vector of the target (at time of calculation) (in relation to shuttle)
-D[tc] - magnitude of V[tc]
-A[tc] - angle of V[tc]

V[tf] - vector of the target (after travel time) (in relation to shuttle)
-A[tf] - angle of V[tf]

V[sp] - vector of the shuttle's position (at time of calculation)
-D[sp] - magnitude of V[sp]
-A[sp] - angle of V[sp]

V[sm] - vector of the shuttle's movement
-D[sm] - magnitude of V[sm]
-A[sm] - angle of V[sm]
~~~~~~~~~~
Base Equations
	time * velocity = distance
	time * acceleration = velocity

Ve[i+1] = Ve[i] + (a * t)

t[i] = sum(t) while i++ sum(t * Ve[i]) <= D[tc]
	Use t[i] to find target planet's location at that time (represented by V[tf])

V[h] = V[tf] - V[s]

~~~~~~~~~~
At each step, the time that would be needed to make a straight path to the target planet's current location is calculated.
	Then, the target's location after that is calculated.
	The resulting position is used as the heading for the shuttle's acceleration.
