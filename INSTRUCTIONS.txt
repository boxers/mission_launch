Instructions


Requirements:

This program requires Java 1.7 and up in order to compile and run.


To Compile:

1. Open command prompt.
2. Go to the directory source/
3. Enter the command: javac -d classes -classpath classes/AbsoluteLayout.jar -sourcepath src src/missionlaunch/*.java

To Run:

1. Go to the directory source/classes/
2. Enter the command: java -classpath .;AbsoluteLayout.jar missionlaunch.MissionLaunch

If step 2 doesn't work, try:

java missionlaunch.MissionLaunch

If that does not work, download the jar files from the repository.
They are in a rar file called mission_launch_jar_file.rar.
Extract the files from it and then run the program using:

java -jar MissionLaunch.jar

If this does not work, then you most likely don't have the right version of Java installed on your machine.
